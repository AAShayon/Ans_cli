## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to Ollama"**:
   - Make sure Ollama is installed and running
   - Start Ollama with: `ollama serve`

2. **"API key not configured"**:
   - Run `hybrid-ai --setup` for interactive configuration
   - Or manually add your API keys to the `.env` file

3. **"Command not found: hybrid-ai"**:
   - Make sure you ran `npm link` during installation

4. **"Sprite MCP not available"**:
   - Install Sprite MCP framework for comprehensive testing
   - Tool will work without it but with limited testing capabilities
   - TestSprite MCP will be used as a fallback for basic testing

5. **"No vision models available"**:
   - Ensure you have configured OpenRouter API key for image processing
   - Or install local vision models if available
