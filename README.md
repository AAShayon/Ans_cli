Setting up API keys for remote AI services is now easier than ever with our interactive setup:

```bash
hybrid-ai --setup
```

This command will guide you through:

1. **Gemini API Setup**:
   - Option to open https://aistudio.google.com/ in your browser
   - Step-by-step instructions for creating an API key
   - Secure terminal-based key entry

2. **Qwen API Setup**:
   - Option to open https://help.aliyun.com/product/148140.html in your browser
   - Guidance for creating an Alibaba Cloud account
   - Secure terminal-based key entry

3. **Configuration Management**:
